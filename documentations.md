## Week 13/09:

* Merge 2 repos into 1:
    - Refac
* New:
    - UpdateRunner as wrapper
    - Integrate Update within horn-pddl

#### Integration:

* In main compiler: UpdateRunner compute cl(T)
    - Extend the OG domain

* Later in compilation: UpdateRunner returns rules

=> Separation between 2 level; Easier Timer for Eval
